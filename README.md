# Challenge-11-Web-Scrapping

1.	Title:  Module 11 Challenge-Web Scrapping

2.	Description:  The focus of the Module 11 Challenge is learning the technique of full web scrapping and data analysis. Identifying HTML elements on a page and identifying the ‘id’ and ‘class’ attributes. This will enable the extraction of information using automated browsing with Splinter, HTML, and parsing with Beautiful Soup. Collecting, organizing, storing, and analyzing data will be required to successfully complete the module. The following are the key areas covered:

a.	Scrape titles and preview text from a Mars news article.
    i.	 Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news site.
    ii.	 Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape
    iii. Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.
    iv.	 Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles.
    v.	 Store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary

b.	Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
    i.	 Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site.
    ii.	 Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
    iii. Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data.
    iv.	 Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
    v.	 Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column.

c.	Data Analysis
    i.	 Using Splinter, HTML and parsing with Beautiful Soup, provides answers to the Title Scraping and Analysis challenge.
3.	Usage

a)	The Web-Scrapping directory will have two Jupyter notebook files titled; Mars_News-Final.ipynb and Mars_Weather-Final.ipynb. In addition, there will be a Mars-Weather_Data.csv file. 
b)	In order to achieve the coding outputs described above, the script sequencing for the Web-Scrapping-Challenge requirements are as follows:
    i.	 Import required file dependencies
    ii.	 Visit and Save the Mars news and HTML from the browser.
    iii. Create a Beautiful Soup object.
    iv.	 Extract the text elements
    v.	 Create an empty dictionary
    vi.	 Loop through the text elements
    vii. Store and print the list

4.	Dependencies
a.	Importing the correct files, accessing the HTML, create the Beautiful Soup object, and extracting the text elements is critical to enable code execution. 

5.	Known Issues: Issues with the script.
a.	There were no know issues with the script that I am aware of.
